Multiple assignment
----------------------------------
The assignments for the Research Track2 course are divided into 3 parts that involve the use of different software, which will be explained below.

Description of [first assignment](https://massimo-carlini.github.io/RT2_Assignment/)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first assignment focuses on using Doxygen to comment the code developed during the second assignment of the first Research Track course.
The files related to this assignment can be found in the `docs` folder of this GitHub repository.

Description of [second assignment](https://github.com/Massimo-Carlini/RT2_Assignment/blob/main/assignment3.ipynb)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The second assignment, instead, involves the use of Jupyter to implement a graphical interface with which a user can interact to perform various actions, such as:

* setting a goal for the robot to reach within the arena.
* deleting the goal that has already been set.

In addition, two graphs have been implemented: one showing the path the robot follows during navigation, and the other dynamically displaying the number of goals that have been reached or deleted.
The file related to this assignment has been named `assignment2.ipynb`.

Description of [third assignment](https://github.com/Massimo-Carlini/RT2_Assignment/blob/main/Report_assignment3.pdf)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The third assignment consists of a statistical analysis to evaluate the performance of one algorithm compared to another. Specifically, two programs developed during the first assignment of the Research Track1 course were taken. The comparison was made between my program and that of a colleague. Based on the collected data, hypotheses were made, an analysis was conducted, and finally, a conclusion was drawn.
The report containing all the details of the conducted analysis has been named `Report_assignment3.pdf`.
